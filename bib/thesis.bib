  abstract  = {The correctness of parallel and reactive programs is often easier specified using formulae of temporal logics. Yet verifying that a system satisfies such specifications is more difficult than verifying safety properties: the recurrence of a specific program state has to be detected. This paper reports on the development of a generic framework for automatic verification of linear temporal logic specifications for programs in LLVM bitcode. Our method searches explicitly through all possible interleavings of parallel threads (control non-determinism) but represents symbolically the variable evaluations (data non-determinism), guided by the specification in order to prove the correctness. To evaluate the framework we compare our method with state-of-the-art tools on a set of unmodified C programs.},
