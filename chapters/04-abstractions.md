# Abstractions

\todo[inline]{ intro to abstractions with some definitions }

## Abstract domains

\todo[inline] { An abstract domain is an abstract algebra, implemented as a library module,
providing a description of abstract program properties and abstract property
transformers describing the operational effect of program instructions and
commands in the abstract. Abstract domains are often complete lattices, an
abstraction of powersets [@Cousot79] }


## Symbolic domain


\todo[inline]{ There are two main approaches to do abstractions of programs: \newline
    1. interprets \newline
    2. compilers
}

\todo[inline]{ Add pros and cons of both approaches }

## LART

- information lossless transformation

- Transformation objectives:
\todo[inline]{ add citation to objectives }

## Data flow analysis
    - annotation propagations

## Data type determination
    - intrinsics creation

## Approximate invariant assertions
    - bcp + assumes

## Domain manipulations insertion
    - substitution

## Other domains
