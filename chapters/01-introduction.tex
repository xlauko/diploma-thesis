Since the early beginnings of computer science, software engineers make prompt
efforts to achieve correctness of software. Nowadays, a common approach used by
the industry is a testing, which enables developers to cover basic use cases.
However, with the growth of software, it hardly scales up to satisfactory
coverage, and may miss some corner cases.

Additionally, testing is in trouble when it encounters some nondeterminism in a
program. We may distinguish two types of nondeterminism. Data nondeterminism
that is introduced by inputs from the environment and control-flow
nondeterminism that is caused by unpredictable interleaving of parallel
programs.

To avoid the problems of testing, many techniques of formal verification have
been invented, such as model checking \cite{Baier08}, abstract interpretation
\cite{Cousot14}, symbolic execution \cite{King76} etc.. These techniques try to
check all the behaviours of the program automatically, hence cover all the
corner cases.

The technique that we are particularly interested in is the explicit-state model
checking. \marginpar{Explicit-state model checking is technique, that
enumerates all the possible states of the program and checks for satisfaction
of given property.} The main use case for model checking is to verify
some property over concurrent programs. This is a big advantage against
the testing, since by the testing we are not able to predict all thread
interleavings and the tests may behave nondeterministically. But,
besides all the advantages of the model checking, it comes with a
drawback. The classic explicit-state model checking approach is useless
for programs with interactions with environment, since it has to verify
the program for each possible input, what requires unmanageable amount
of work (also known as state space explosion problem).

To tackle the problem with program inputs a few extensions of explicit-state
model checking have been introduced over the time -- abstraction-based model
checking \cite{Clarke94} or symbolic model checking \cite{Clarke96}.  These
techniques try to group the inputs that do not change the behaviour of the
program, and verify programs only according to those groups (or representant
taken form the group). For example function that returns whether the
number is greater than zero, we can separate inputs to 2 groups -- numbers
bigger then zero, and numbers less than or equal to zero.

In thesis thesis we would like to introduce a novel approach how to deal with
inputs of verified programs. In the approaches mentioned before, the
nondeterminism brought by inputs is commonly processed directly by verification
tool. Our idea is to transform the program in such a way, that it will simulate
the nondeterminism of inputs independently of the verification tool (i.e. the
grouping of the inputs). Hence the verification tool does not need to
provide a support for the input handling (data nondeterminism). Moreover
explicit-state model checkers should be able to verify such a program without
suffering from the state space explosion.

To be precise, we want to create a tool that will take a program and replace the
nondeterministic data by some arbitrary representation of the group of inputs (
i.e.~some abstraction of the input).
\marginpar{For example when we subtract a value one from the group of values
$\{1,5,12\}$ the resulting group is $\{0,4,11\}$.}
Similarly transform the manipulations with input data to the manipulations
on the groups of data.

Traditionally the similar approach is done by interpreting the program and
representing the nondeterministic data internally in the verification tool.
Our proposal is not to complicate the verification tool, and let the program do
the work and manipulate the abstract values directly.

To achieve this we propose that instead of interpreting the program
instructions in abstract way, the abstraction can be compiled into the program
directly (by program transformation). Hence the transformed program will
manipulate with abstract representation of the input instead of concrete value.

The program transformed in this way can be then forwarded for analysis to
arbitrary an verification tool. Moreover, we want the abstracted program to be
runnable on its own as usual program.

In this work we will present how such transformation can be achieved and how
the abstract data can be represented. Basic abstractions and the whole program
transformation with all its analysis is described in the chapter \ref{ch:abstraction}.

A part of this thesis is also the implementation of the mere program
transformation, this is done in the tool called \LART which is part of the
\DIVINE model checker toolchain. Both tools will be described in the
\autoref{ch:divine}. In this chapter we will also cover another approaches for the
input abstraction, from which we have taken the inspiration. To be precise a
\SymDIVINE approach of handling inputs will be explored.

In the preliminaries \autoref{ch:preliminaries}, we will cover the input
language for our transformation (\LLVM), and we will define what is model
checking more precisely.

The results of the work will be summed up in the chapter \autoref{ch:results},
with evaluation on the subset of \textsc{sv-comp} (software verification
competition) benchmarks and on greater example of avl tree.
