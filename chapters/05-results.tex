\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:results}

The resulting transformation is able to handle programs where only integer
arithmetic is abstracted. We provide ability for pointers to point on the
abstract values and structures to contain abstract elements. However we are
currently not able to insert abstract values into arrays and abstract pointers
(i.e. memory allocation). These limitations are caused by insufficient
representation of symbolic data, in the case of arrays, and missing pointer
analysis in the case of pointers. For further evaluation we have omitted
programs that contain these unsupported characteristics.

Other technicalities, such as support of threading and support of full \Cpp{}
standard library remains untouched, since transformations do not interfere with
explicit computation of a program.

To show that the proposed approach is sufficient replacement of \SymDIVINE, we
will compare the symbolic transformation with \DIVINE as backend against \SymDIVINE.
Evaluation will be done on two sets of benchmarks --- subset of benchmarks from
software verification competition (\textsc{sv-comp})~\cite{Beyer17} and
benchmarks of data structures, concretely binary trees and more complicated AVL
tree. The AVL tree benchmark demonstrates the ability of transformation of more
complicated code, and also of the verification by explicit model checker.
