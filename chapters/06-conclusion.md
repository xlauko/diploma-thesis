# Conclusion

## Future work

\todo[inline]{ Extend domain support to predicate abstraction. }
\todo[inline]{ Add memory abstraction. }
\todo[inline]{ Add foats abstraction. }
\todo[inline]{ Do CEGAR for unprecise domains - from abstract trace extract concrete trace
               -> sim -> refine -> profit  }
\todo[inline]{ Idea of control flow narrowing = extract model from counter
    example and isert the corresponding assumes to program }

\todo[inline]{ Potential optimizations after abstraction pass. ( inlining of
        abstract instructions }
