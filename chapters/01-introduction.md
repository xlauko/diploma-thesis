\noindent
Since the early beginnings of computer science,
software engineers struggle to proof correctness of software.

- testing hardly scales up with software growth and with a satisfactory
coverage


\todo[inline]{ Motivation, problem description }
\todo[inline]{ Setting in divine world }
To verify real world programs, DIVINE builds model from llvm. Hence the model
corresponds precisely to program execution.

## Aims

Abstraction of program have no cost for explicit program verification, since
model checker is not modified. Only interpretation of abstracted values adds
cost to model checking, but since the abstracted values narrows the domain of
values, the size of the state space will be decreased.
