# DIVINE and friends {#chap03}

In this chapter we will introduce idea of model checking. We will describe an
approach of DIVINE tool. And on top of that we will try to tackle problem of
handling inputs by symbolic model checking [ as introduced in Havel ]. We will
try to emphasize the differences between classical model checking algorithm and
symbolic algorithm. In order to decompose symbolic part in following chapter.

## Model checking

## Symbolic model checking

## Verification toolchain
