\chapter*{Abstract}

To show a reliability of software, developers usually reach out for testing
and static analysis. However, to prove correctness, all behaviours of a
program need to be checked. In this respect, formal verification methods aim to
provide an automated approach to verification. A big obstacle are inputs because they massively increase the number of behaviours of the program.

In this thesis, we present a technique which enables verification tools to
perform automated checking of programs with inputs. A generally known approach
is to interpret operations with input values in an abstract way. In this case,
abstraction needs to be implemented in the verification tool. We propose that
instead, an abstraction can be compiled into the program. Hence, the program
can be verified by a tool even though the tool itself does not support
abstraction of inputs.

We implement the proposed approach as an \LLVM-to-\LLVM transformation which
inserts an abstraction to the program. The applicability of the proposed
approach is demonstrated by transforming programs to represent their inputs
symbolically. This, in turn, enables an essentially explicit-state model checker
to verify the program. For evaluation purposes, we have chosen \DIVINE as the model checker.
